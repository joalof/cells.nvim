# cells.nvim
**cells.nvim** is a minimal Neovim plugin for partitioning code into **cells**, which can be used for navigation and communicating chunks of code to jupyter kernels/REPls via plugins such as [molten.nvim](https://github.com/benlubas/molten.nvim), [iron.nvim](https://github.com/hkupty/iron.nvim), or [toggleterm.nvim](https://github.com/akinsho/toggleterm.nvim). The plugin provides a cell text object and some utility functions for cell manipulation.


## üì¶ What is a cell?
A **cell** is a contiguous block of code, typically used as a unit of execution. In `cells.nvim`, a cell is bounded by a comment containing a pre-designated **delimiter** (by default `%%`). The beginning and end of a file (BOF/EOF) are also considered implicit cell boundaries.

For example, in Python:

```python
print("This is cell 1")

# %%
print("This is cell 2")

print("Still in cell 2")

# %%
print('Cell 3 now')
```

## üîå Installation
Install with you favourite plugin manager, for example with [Lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

```lua
{
  "joalof/cells.nvim",
  config = function()
    require("cells").setup()
  end,
  event = "VeryLazy",
}
```

[NotebookNavigator.nvim](https://github.com/GCBallesteros/NotebookNavigator.nvim) provides richer integrations and features. In contrast, **cells.nvim** is intentionally minimal and dependency-free.
